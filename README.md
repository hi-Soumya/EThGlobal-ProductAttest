Project Idea: Decentralized Marketplace Verification for Instagram Sellers

**Problem**: Trust issues exist when buying products through social media platforms like Instagram. Buyers are often uncertain about the legitimacy of sellers and the authenticity of products.

**Solution**: Build a decentralized application where Instagram sellers can create verifiable attestations of their products using **Sign Protocol**. Buyers can then verify these attestations to ensure they are purchasing from legitimate sellers with authentic products.
